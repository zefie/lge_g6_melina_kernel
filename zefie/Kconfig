	  Select which CPU optimization flags, if any, you wish to compile
	  the kernel with. Please note that some options are incompatible
	  with the clang compiler.

	  If unsure, use the selected default.

          Allows you to mount CD-ROM ISO images with DriveDroid.
          Without this, the image will try to mount as a USB Disk (flash drive).

	  This is just a helper variable that enables the following:
	  CPU_INPUT_BOOST and TCP_CONG_WESTWOOD


config MELINA_WARN_AS_ERR
	bool "Treat compile warnings as errors (-Werror)"
        default y
	help
	  Disabling this option will allow the kernel to compile with warnings, but is not advised.

	  If unsure, say y here.

	select FB_MSM_MDSS_XLOG_DEBUG
	help
	  Select this to have a fully verbose kernel, like LGE's stock.
	  Selecting this turns on full kernel debug support, and may trigger a NOTICE when booting Android.
	  Select "Enhanced Debug Removal" to disable debug support, and remove the warning, but at the cost
	  of making it more difficult to debug.

	  This option may cause a NOTICE in the kernel log during Android boot regarding 
          a DEBUG kernel and "trace_printk". The warning is harmless, but this may slightly
	  reduce performance.  However, it will make it easier to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say Y here while developing, then say N here when making a public release.

menuconfig MELINA_DEBUG_DISABLE
	bool "Enable Melina Kernel Optimized Debug Removal"
        default n
	help
	  These options significantly reduce the amount of debug information processed and displayed by
	  the Qualcomm, Broadcom and LGE drivers, slightly improving performance.

	  Under this menu, you can enable and disable specific device driver debug.

	  This option is required to remove the "trace_printk" warning on Android boot.
	  This may slightly increase performance, but will make it harder to diagnose any problems.

	  If unsure, say N here while developing, then say Y here when making a public release.
